Mastermind game 

Ruby 2.3.0
rvm 1.27.0
Linux Ubuntu 16.04 lts

Creating a mastermind game with console interface, playable by 1 user against computer in the console. User can be the codebreaker or the codemaker.
Couldn't figure it out how to analyze the codes when 2 of the same type are next to each other. So instead I'm checking not to get that kind of input from user.

Future improvement options: 
- include graphic interface
